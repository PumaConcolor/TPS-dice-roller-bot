# TPS dice roller bot

A free and open source telegram bot that you can find [here](https://telegram.me/TPS_dice_roller_bot).

Made by  [me](https://github.com/PumaConcolor) and [Jacopo De Angelis](https://github.com/JacopoDeAngelis) using [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) in our spare time.

The primary function of the bot is to roll dice (with any number of sides), and other fun things related primarily to D&D style RPGs.

## Commands
`/roll`, short `/r`: rolls dice as specified using [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation)

`/ability_scores`, short `/as`: rolls six basic ability scores for use in D&D style game systems

`/alive`: returns the emotional state of the bot

`/spongebob`, short `/sp`: followed by a sentence, replies with the saltier version

`/spongerep`, short `/spr`: similar to the previous one, used answering to a message, returns the saltier version

`/edgelord`: creates an edgy backstory for your next character

`/character`, short `/char` : creates a fully fledged character
